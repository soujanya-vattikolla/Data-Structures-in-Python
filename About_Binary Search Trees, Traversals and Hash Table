**What is the purpose of defining the functions str and repr within a class?**

str() and repr() both are used to get a string representation of object.
str() is used for creating output for end user and it is more readable
repr() is used for debugging and development and is to be unambiguous

# example for str():

s = 'Hello everyone'
print(str(s))
print(str(2.0/11.0))

Output: Hello everyone
        0.18181818181818182
